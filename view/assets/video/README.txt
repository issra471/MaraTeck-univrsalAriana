PLEASE READ:

To enable the video background:
1. Find a high-quality video that matches the "UniVersElle Ariana" theme (e.g., slow motion people helping, abstract blue/red motion).
2. Rename the video file to 'hero-bg.mp4'.
3. Place the file in this folder: c:\xampp\htdocs\maratech\view\assets\video\

The website is already configured to load 'hero-bg.mp4' from this location.
Until you add the file, a fallback gradient will be shown.
